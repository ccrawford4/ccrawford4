## Intro
Hello my name is Calum. I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of San Francisco. I've had three prior internships in software engineering and I love building applications. Through personal projects I have improved my skills in Full-stack development, Cloud Infrastrucutre/Deployment, DevOps, and Machine Learning. More recently, I have been working on improving my programming skills in mobile development, specifically in Swift for iOS development using XCode and SwiftUI. Currently, I am employed as a Full Stack Software Engineer Intern at a Redesign Health backed Stealth Venture.
