## About
Cloud Engineer at Handshake. I enjoy backend engineering, infrastructure, automation, and building performant systems. 

### What I've been working on

**September 2025 - Present**
* [Self-Managed K8s Cluster](https://github.com/ccrawford4/home). Taking it a step further, and deploying all my old projects on a self-managed Kuberentes cluster running on some Rasberry Pis. See [search.calum.run](https://search.calum.run) for example. I manage all my applications using ArgoCD [here](https://argocd.calum.run)

**August 2025 - Present**
* [Kubernetes from scratch](https://github.com/ccrawford4/kubeadm-example). Going back to the fundamentals and working on creating my first self-managed kubernetes cluster. No GKE, minikube or other abstractions - just kubeadm hosted on google vms.

**July - August 2025**
* Contributed to [total](https://github.com/edwardshturman/total), an open-sourced expense tracker which brings all of your income sources to one place

**May - July 2025**
